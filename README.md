# DNA Sequence Analysis Tool

A simple Python script for beginner-to-intermediate bioinformatics tasks, including GC content calculation, reverse complement generation, motif finding, and reading multiple sequences from FASTA files.

## Features
- **GC Content Calculation**: Computes the percentage of G and C bases in a DNA sequence.
- **Reverse Complement**: Generates the reverse complement of a DNA sequence (A↔T, G↔C).
- **Motif Finding**: Identifies all occurrences of a specific motif within a DNA sequence.
- **Melting Temperature**: Calculates Tm using the Wallace rule (2°C * (A+T) + 4°C * (G+C)).
- **Molecular Weight**: Estimates the molecular weight of single-stranded DNA.
- **Error Handling**: Validates DNA sequences and raises errors for invalid bases (non-A, T, G, C characters).
- **Multi-Sequence FASTA Support**: Reads and analyzes multiple DNA sequences from a single FASTA file.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x (No external libraries required)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/bioinformatics_dna_analysis.git
